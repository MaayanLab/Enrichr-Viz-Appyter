# Enrichment Analysis Visualizer Pre-Processed Libraries

Pre-processed library files required for the scatter plot and hexagonal canvas plots in the Enrichment Analysis Visualizer Appyter are stored in their respectively labeled folders. The Python scripts (\*.py files) used to pre-process library files for each plot can also be found in each folder, and are the cleaned versions of the original Jupyter Notebook files (\*.ipynb files). 

New libraries may be processed by filling in the library names where noted in the scripts, and changing any path names or file endpoints as needed. New libraries must also be added to the list of accepted inputs to the [Enrichment Analysis Visualization Appyter](https://github.com/MaayanLab/appyter-catalog/tree/enrichr-viz-update/appyters/Enrichment_Analysis_Visualizer).
