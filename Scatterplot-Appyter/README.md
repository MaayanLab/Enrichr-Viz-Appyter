# Enrichr Scatterplot Appyter

This appyter creates a scatterplot which visualizes gene set enrichment results on a preprocessed Enrichr library.

The scatterplot is organized so that simliar gene sets are clustered together. Enriched gene sets will appear blue instead of gray, with the most significant enriched term appearing green on the plot. The name of the gene set and the associated p-value are displayed when a point is hovered over and the names and p-values of significant terms are provided in a table output below the plot. 

Individual plots can be downloaded as an svg using the save function on the toolbar next to the plot.
