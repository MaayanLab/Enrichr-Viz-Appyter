# Enrichr Scatterplot Appyter

This appyter creates a scatterplot which visualizes gene set enrichment results on a preprocessed Enrichr library. The scatterplot is organized so that simliar gene sets are clustered together. Enriched gene sets will appear black instead of blue. The name of the gene set and the associated p-value are displayed when a point is hovered over.
