# Enrichr Scatterplot Appyter

This appyter creates a scatterplot which visualizes gene set enrichment results on a preprocessed Enrichr library. The scatterplot is organized so that simliar gene sets are clustered together. Enriched gene sets will appear blue instead of gray, with the most significant enriched term appearing green on the plot. The name of the gene set and the associated p-value are displayed when a point is hovered over and the name and p-value of the most significant enriched term is displayed in a legend below the plot.
