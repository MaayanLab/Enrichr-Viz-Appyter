# Manhattan-Plot-Appyter

This appyter creates manhattan plots visualizing Enrichr data. The x-axis of the 
plot is sectioned by Enrichr libraries and sub-sectioned by gene sets from within
the libraries. The y-axis of the plot has the -log(p value) for each gene set.
There is an option for a significance line to be displayed, any points that exist
above the line are labeled and displayed in a legend to the side of the plot. 
There are also options for different labeling and legend styles of the plot and 
different color schemes. Plots can be downloaded as a png, pdf, or svg.
