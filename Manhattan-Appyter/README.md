# Manhattan-Plot-Appyter

This appyter creates manhattan plots visualizing Enrichr data. The x-axis of the plot
is sectioned by Enrichr libraries and sub-sectioned by gene sets from within the 
libraries. The y-axis of the plot has the -log(p value) for each gene set. There is
an option for a significance line to be displayed. Any points that exist above the 
line are labeled and displayed in a legend to the side of the plot. Plots can
be downloaded as a png, pdf, or svg.
